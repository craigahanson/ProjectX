                     * parent scope) got disposed of as it should.
                     *

                     * the ambient context before creating the task - that way we wouldn't have captured
                     * this bogus parent scope.
                     * 
                     * While this is definitely a programming error, it's not worth throwing here. We can only 
                     * be in one of two scenario:
                     * 
                     * - If the developer who created the parallel task was mindful to force the creation of 
                     * a new scope in the parallel task (with IDbContextScopeFactory.CreateNew() instead of 
                     * JoinOrCreate()) then no harm has been done. We haven't tried to access the same DbContext
                     * instance from multiple threads.
                     * 
                     * - If this was not the case, they probably already got an exception complaining about the same
                     * DbContext or ObjectContext being accessed from multiple threads simultaneously (or a related
                     * error like multiple active result sets on a DataReader, which is caused by attempting to execute
                     * several queries in parallel on the same DbContext instance). So the code has already blow up.
                     *

         * This is where all the magic happens. And there is not much of it.
         * 
         * This implementation is inspired by the source code of the
         * TransactionScope class in .NET 4.5.1 (the TransactionScope class
         * is prior versions of the .NET Fx didn't have support for async
         * operations).
         * 
         * In order to understand this, you'll need to be familiar with the
         * concept of async points. You'll also need to be familiar with the
         * ExecutionContext and CallContext and understand how and why they 
         * flow through async points. Stephen Toub has written an
         * excellent blog post about this - it's a highly recommended read:
         * http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2012/06/15/executioncontext-vs-synchronizationcontext.aspx
         * 
         * Overview: 
         * 
         * We want our DbContextScope instances to be ambient within 
         * the context of a logical flow of execution. This flow may be 
         * synchronous or it may be asynchronous.
         * 
         * If we only wanted to support the synchronous flow scenario, 
         * we could just store our DbContextScope instances in a ThreadStatic 
         * variable. That's the "traditional" (i.e. pre-async) way of implementing
         * an ambient context in .NET. You can see an example implementation of 
         * a TheadStatic-based ambient DbContext here: http://coding.abel.nu/2012/10/make-the-dbcontext-ambient-with-unitofworkscope/ 
         * 
         * But that would be hugely limiting as it would prevent us from being
         * able to use the new async features added to Entity Framework
         * in EF6 and .NET 4.5.
         * 
         * So we need a storage place for our DbContextScope instances 
         * that can flow through async points so that the ambient context is still 
         * available after an await (or any other async point). And this is exactly 
         * what CallContext is for.
         * 
         * There are however two issues with storing our DbContextScope instances 
         * in the CallContext:
         * 
         * 1) Items stored in the CallContext should be serializable. That's because
         * the CallContext flows not just through async points but also through app domain 
         * boundaries. I.e. if you make a remoting call into another app domain, the
         * CallContext will flow through this call (which will require all the values it
         * stores to get serialized) and get restored in the other app domain.
         * 
         * In our case, our DbContextScope instances aren't serializable. And in any case,
         * we most definitely don't want them to be flown accross app domains. So we'll
         * use the trick used by the TransactionScope class to work around this issue.
         * Instead of storing our DbContextScope instances themselves in the CallContext,
         * we'll just generate a unique key for each instance and only store that key in 
         * the CallContext. We'll then store the actual DbContextScope instances in a static
         * Dictionary against their key. 
         * 
         * That way, if an app domain boundary is crossed, the keys will be flown accross
         * but not the DbContextScope instances since a static variable is stored at the 
         * app domain level. The code executing in the other app domain won't see the ambient
         * DbContextScope created in the first app domain and will therefore be able to create
         * their own ambient DbContextScope if necessary.
         * 
         * 2) The CallContext is flow through *all* async points. This means that if someone
         * decides to create multiple threads within the scope of a DbContextScope, our ambient scope
         * will flow through all the threads. Which means that all the threads will see that single 
         * DbContextScope instance as being their ambient DbContext. So clients need to be 
         * careful to always suppress the ambient context before kicking off a parallel operation
         * to avoid our DbContext instances from being accessed from multiple threads.
